### Garage Door Opener/Closer
Using a Raspberry Pi and a garage door remote, should be able to open/close garage door from authorized mobile devices
anywhere, as long as you are connected to the internet.

The Raspberry Pi will act as a web server, that controls the garage door. Mobile devices will have apps installed on
them to communicate with this web server.
